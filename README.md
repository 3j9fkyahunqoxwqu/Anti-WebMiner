# Compatibility

# Why?

The coin mining in a browser using scripts like Coinhive is a real problem for everyone.
These scripts may cause your browsers working slow or fully unresponsive, drain a battery of your notebook.
Any webmaster may add only one line to a code of website to start monetizing by coin mining.

# How to Protect?

Anti-WebMiner blocks scripts using a "blacklist" database of hosts like "Coinhive".
Anti-WebMiner modifies a Windows hosts file for disabling connection attempts to "blacklisted" sites.

# Benefits!
 
This protection works for all browers. 
You don't need to install a browser extension.
